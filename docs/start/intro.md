Sandstone is a Typescript library for Minecraft Datapacks. It allows easy creation, debug and sharing of Minecraft functions, loot tables, predicates etc...

## Features

### Perfect autocompletion & built-in Wiki

Sandstone tells you what a command expects, and autocomplete complicated arguments for you. It ships with the official Wiki documentation for all commands and resources.

You don't need to remember commands syntax anymore.

This autocompletion works for commands, predicates, loot tables, advancements...

### Easy to share
Sharing commands has **never been easier**. Just publish your functions on NPM, and everyone can use them to improve their own datapacks.

### Designed for developers
Sandstone is designed with developer experience in mind. The goal is to provide a beautiful library, easy to understand and to use, with enough abstractions to empower Datapack creators. Sandstone does not force its abstractions on you: you can fine-tune your functions for performance, just like you would in vanilla Minecraft functions - but with all Sandstone advantages!
